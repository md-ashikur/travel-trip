                    <b>authorization</b> determines what resources a user can access. It always takes place after authentication and isnâ€™t visible to or changeable by the user. whereas <br></br><b>authentication</b> is the process of verifying who the user is. it's partially changeable by the user. it's a good identity and access management process.
