            <p>My long-term goal is to achieve a good position as a software engineer in a multinational company and
                to become a more responsible and knowledgeable personality.

                My short-term goal is to get a job in a reputed company. Currently, I want to settle in a good organisation where I get a good platform. I will work hard with a positive attitude, honesty, and punctuality until I finish my work in the given time.
